These files are examples of the Tweener class for the Actionscript language
under the Flash platform.

They are built with several different versions of the tools available for the
Flash platform - different versions of the Flash IDE, using Adobe's own
compilers or third party tools. As such, they're meant to show how the Tweener
class can be used under each different development scenario.

Keep in mind that the way the source files look is not meant to represent
anything other than placeholder functionality or graphics, many times in a
metaphorical sense. They're not clipart or copy&paste components but rather
sample code for people to learn from.

Please notice that all source files are included, including the Tweener classes
itself. This is mostly for demonstration purposes, however, and the Tweener
version included might be outdated. The examples will work, but for your own
usage, it's recommended that you download the most recent Tweener version and
replace the example's zipped one with it. Here's where you can find it:

  * ZIP archives for stable versions:
    http://code.google.com/p/tweener/downloads/list

  * Online SVN repository for development versions:
    http://tweener.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

  * More information about the SVN repository:

Also, remember sources are provided mostly for research and learning purposes,
but you are free to reuse any code provided for your own intentions. Just be
fair and don't claim ownership or having authored any of it. Just use common
sense.
